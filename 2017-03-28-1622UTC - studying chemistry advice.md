> I think that this is not really dependent on whether you learn chemistry, math, or anything else:
> 
> * If you struggle with fundamentals that your current material is based on, you rather spend time on those fundamentals. It'll be a waste of time fighting with the advanced material if you don't know the basics.
> * Find alternative sources and alternative viewpoints. Often one teacher explains things better than the other. Try to find different explanations from different people. Internet gives a lot of possibilities in this area. You can start with Khan Academy and Coursera for instance.
> * Relate the material to the real life. Don't just learn theory - try to find something around that you could explain with that theory. Even better - try to find a work/hobby that relates to that theory - you'd spend a lot more time with the subject with more joy.
> * Communicate. StackExchange is one of the places. And be sure not only to ask, but also to answer - when answering you're diving much deeper into the area.
> * Enjoy. Everything is easier when you enjoy doing it. This usually comes naturally when you see practical application of your knowledge.
> * Don't rush. Rush kills the joy and stimulates learning material at the surface.
