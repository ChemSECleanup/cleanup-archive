From Dissenter's answer to the deleted question formerly here:

http://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/14471/why-is-coating-with-an-oxide-considered-oxidation

> In sum, oxidation is defined as an increase in oxidation state. Oxidation states are assigned by first supposing all bonding to be ionic, or non electron sharing.  
> 
> Oxygen, being the second most electronegative element on the periodic table, will therefore almost always be assigned all the bonding electrons (except in cases such as peroxides and hypofluorus acid). 
> 
> Thus, the formation of an oxide can be viewed as the oxidation of a metal, which usually have low electronegativity values. The oxygen in the metal oxide will be assigned all bonding electrons and will thus be reduced, and the metal simultaneously oxidized.
